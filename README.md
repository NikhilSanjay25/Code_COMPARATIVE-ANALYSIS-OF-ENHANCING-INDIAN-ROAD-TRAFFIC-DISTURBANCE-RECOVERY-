Comparative Analysis of Enhancing Indian Road  Traffic Disturbance Recovery Code 
 •
 International Conference on Emerging Technologies in  Computing  and Communication (ETCC)
 Conducted a comparative study of optimization techniques—Particle Swarm Optimization 
(PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Genetic Algorithm (GA)—to improve traffic 
disturbance recovery in Indian road traffic systems.
 Simulation models in MATLAB using Differential 
Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
to optimize recovery strategies for disrupted Indian road traffic conditions.
 •
 Integrated real-world parameters—including signal delays, reckless driving, railroad 
delays, emissions, fuel consumption, and travel time deviations—into an existing 
objective function to reflect realistic traffic scenarios.
 •
 Designed and ran algorithm-specific optimization loops with convergence checks, early 
stopping, and dynamic fitness tracking across generations.
 •
 Visualized performance trends using MATLAB to compare efficiency, convergence speed, 
and solution quality across all three algorithms.
 •
 Demonstrated the practical applicability of evolutionary approaches in urban traffic 
recovery and congestion mitigation.
